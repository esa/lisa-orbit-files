# lisa-orbit-files
A repository to share the official ESA LISA science orbit files with the LISA consortium.

##  Repository structure
* The LISA science orbits are stored as OEM (Orbit Ephemeris Message) files that can be read, for instance, using [this](https://pypi.org/project/oem/) Python package.
* The files correspond to versions of the CReMA (Consolidated Report on Mission Analysis) that is issued by the ESA/ESOC Mission Analysis section. As the CReMA is updated, new folders with updated files will be added to this repository.

## Acronyms:
* CReMA (Consolidated Report on Mission Analysis)
* MIDA (Mean Initial Displacement angle): The displacement angle of the LISA constellation from the Mean Earth at the beginning of science phase. Positive values indicate an Earth-leading configuration, negative values an Earth-trailing configuration.
* cw/ccw (clockwise/counter-clockwise): Indicates the apparent rotation of the constellation as seen from the Sun.
