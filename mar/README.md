## File Description

The OEM files in this folder were added answering a request for the Mission Adoption Review (MAR) to provide
both clockwise and counter-clockwise options for both heading and trailing orbits.
The clockwise orbits are close to the ones in the `crema_1p0` folder, but slightly different
due to some software updates. A deterministic self-gravity induced acceleration linearly varying between -2 nm/s2 to +2 nm/s2 towards the constellation center is included in all orbits.
